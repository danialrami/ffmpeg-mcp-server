# FFmpeg MCP Server for Audio Processing

A secure, containerized MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that provides AI assistants with anything FFmpeg. Process entire directories of audio files with consistent output format while maintaining security through Docker sandboxing.

## Features

- **Universal Audio Format Support**: Processes 40+ audio formats including WAV, MP3, FLAC, OGG, M4A, and more
- **Standardized Output**: All files converted to 48kHz, 32-bit WAV format with preserved channel count
- **Batch Processing**: Process entire directories with progress tracking and detailed reporting
- **Security First**: 
  - All FFmpeg commands run in sandboxed Docker containers
  - Network access disabled during processing
  - Comprehensive command sanitization
  - File size limits (default 7GB)
- **Intelligent Processing**:
  - Automatic audio metadata extraction
  - Channel count preservation
  - Timestamped output directories prevent overwrites
  - Timeout protection (5 minutes per file)
- **MCP Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with AI assistants supporting the Model Context Protocol

## What It's For

This tool is designed for audio professionals, sound designers, and developers who need to:
- Apply consistent processing to large audio libraries
- Convert between audio formats while maintaining quality
- Apply FFmpeg filters and effects safely in batch operations
- Integrate audio processing into AI-powered workflows
- Ensure reproducible, standardized output formats

## Requirements

### System Requirements
- **Python**: 3.7 or higher
- **Docker**: Installed and running
- **MCP Framework**: `pip install mcp`
- **Storage**: Sufficient space for audio files (supports up to 7GB per file)

### Automatic Setup
The server automatically:
- Checks all dependencies on startup
- Pulls the FFmpeg Docker image if not present
- Validates system readiness before processing

## Installation

1. **Clone or download this repository**

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install mcp
   ```

3. **Ensure Docker is installed and running**:
   ```bash
   docker --version
   docker ps
   ```

4. **Run the server**:
   ```bash
   python ffmpeg_server.py
   ```

## Usage

### As an MCP Server

The server exposes three main tools for AI assistants:

#### 1. `any_ffmpeg_command`
Process audio files with custom FFmpeg commands:
```python
{
    "directory": "/path/to/audio/files",
    "command_template": ["-i", "{input}", "-af", "loudnorm", "{output}"],
    "file_extensions": ["wav", "mp3"],  # Optional: defaults to all audio formats
    "output_subdir": "processed",       # Optional: defaults to "output"
    "max_file_size_mb": 7000           # Optional: defaults to 7000 (7GB)
}
```

#### 2. `get_audio_processing_info`
Get information about server capabilities:
- Supported audio formats
- Available FFmpeg flags
- Example command templates
- Current Docker status

#### 3. `check_system_dependencies`
Verify all system dependencies are met:
- Python version
- Docker availability
- FFmpeg image status
- MCP framework

### Example FFmpeg Commands

The server includes several example templates:

```python
# Simple format conversion
["-i", "{input}", "{output}"]

# Audio normalization
["-i", "{input}", "-af", "loudnorm", "{output}"]

# Trim audio (10s to 30s)
["-i", "{input}", "-ss", "10", "-t", "20", "{output}"]

# Apply reverb effect
["-i", "{input}", "-af", "aecho=0.8:0.9:1000:0.3", "{output}"]

# Normalize and compress
["-i", "{input}", "-af", "loudnorm,acompressor=threshold=-20dB:ratio=4:attack=5:release=50", "{output}"]
```

### Output Structure

Processed files are saved in timestamped directories:
```
input_directory/
â”œâ”€â”€ audio1.mp3
â”œâ”€â”€ audio2.flac
â”œâ”€â”€ processed_20250103_143052/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ audio1_processed.wav
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ audio2_processed.wav
â””â”€â”€ processed_20250103_151230/
    â””â”€â”€ audio1_processed.wav
```

## Security Features

- **Sandboxed Execution**: All FFmpeg commands run in Docker containers with no network access
- **Command Sanitization**: Whitelist-based validation of FFmpeg flags and arguments
- **Shell Injection Protection**: Comprehensive checks for malicious characters
- **Resource Limits**: File size limits and processing timeouts
- **User Isolation**: Containers run as unprivileged users

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom File Size Limits
Adjust the `max_file_size_mb` parameter (default: 7000 MB)

### Processing Timeout
Currently set to 5 minutes per file (hardcoded)

### Supported FFmpeg Flags
The server supports a comprehensive whitelist of audio processing flags including:
- Audio codecs and formats
- Quality and bitrate settings
- Filters and effects
- Metadata handling
- Time-based operations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Docker not available"**
   - Ensure Docker Desktop is running
   - Check Docker daemon: `docker ps`

2. **"FFmpeg Docker image not found"**
   - The server will auto-pull the image
   - Manual pull: `docker pull jrottenberg/ffmpeg`

3. **"Missing Python dependencies"**
   - Install MCP: `pip install mcp`

4. **Processing timeouts**
   - Check file sizes and complexity
   - Simplify FFmpeg filters if needed

### Debug Mode
Run with Python's verbose flag for detailed output:
```bash
python -v ffmpeg_mcp_server.py
```
